This credit opinion was produced for a university course with the aim of learning how Moody's and similar rating agencies asses the credit rating of a financial institution. The report was formatted in a similar way to Moody's reports for the project, but all of the numbers, figures and opinions present in the report are my own and do not represent those of Moody's or any other rating agency. All of the information was taken from public sources, primarily the annual reports of the company.
